			<h2 style="font-size: 25px;" class="addCentering">The British Shorthair Cat</h2>
		      <p class="content_addOn">The British Shorthair, while originally coming from the farms and streets of Britain, is also considered to be the first cat of the cat fancy. 
			  The "father" of this breed is Harrison Wier, who is thought of as the first professional cat breeder. 
			  He is known in cat fancy history as the "Father of the Cat Fancy." Not only was he the first professional breeder, 
			  but he also determined the rules for the first cat show, which was held in Britain in 1871. As if this were not enough, Harrison took the humble street cat of Britain and, 
			  through an intensive breeding program, transformed it to the pedigreed breed that he named the British. The British fell in love with their new now-pedigreed breed. 
			  When the Persian was introduced into Britain, it nudged out the British for the most popular breed temporarily. During the Second World War, as in the First World War, 
			  the British Shorthair breed was decimated, but it always reemerged into the top ranks of popularity. Today, the British shorthair is accepted in cat registries worldwide. 
			  At one time, it was known as the British Blue, but since it comes in a variety of colors, it is called either the British or the British Shorthair. </p>

			<h2 style="font-size: 25px;">The Scottish Fold Cat</h2>
		      <p class="content_addOn">Scottish fold cats are known for their trademark folded ears that make for an adorable look. They have round faces and big round eyes, and their folded ears make them appear even rounder. 
			  In fact, they’re often compared to teddy bears or owls. Because of their cute appearance and sweet temperament, they’re very sought-after and beloved by many. Their ears are their signature feature, and they’re completely fascinating. 
			  But there are other interesting facts to know about these kitties. How much do you know about Scottish fold cats? Read on to learn some surprising facts about them! While cats with folded ears date back to the 1700s, Scottish fold cats first came about in the 1960s. 
			  In 1961 in Perth shire, Scotland, a kitten with folded ears was discovered in a litter of non-folded cats. This kitten was named Susie. She was bred with other cats to develop the breed, and subsequently, all Scottish fold cats have her as a common ancestor. Their ear folds are categorized into three types: single, double, and triple. 
			  According to MIT, “Today’s folds have ear folds ranging from the loose single fold to the very tight triple fold which is seen in the show quality cats.” A single fold is just a slight fold that only involves the tips of the ears. 
			  A double fold ear has a more prominent bend than a single fold ear, with about half of the ear bending downward. A triple fold ear lies flat against the head, making the head appear rounder. Scottish fold cats didn’t always have sharply folded ears; 
			  they have become a fixture in these cats through years of selective breeding, with breeders choosing only cats with double and triple folds.</p>

			<h2 style="font-size: 25px;">The Bengal Cat</h2>
		      <p class="content_addOn">The Bengal might look like a wild cat, but some people agree that this breed is as sweet as any domestic cat. Bengals are playful, gregarious, active cats with a generous dose of feline curiosity, full of life, and people-oriented. 
			  The Bengal fans rave about their character and playful antics. With their family, Bengals develop close bonds of love and devotion and become devoted, affectionate, fun-loving mates, given you reach them halfway and give them in return the love they need. Athletic and athletic, the Bengals love 
			  to ascend and gravitate to the highest stage in every space. The Bengals are also an outstanding source of entertainment. Their intellect is one of the primary attributes that makes them so unique as companions. Not unexpectedly, as living in the jungle requires wit and lightning reflexes, Bengals are sharp as fuzzy tacks.The Bengals understand and love discovering new habits very quickly. 
			  They can practice tricks that you would like not to do, such as flipping on and off light switches, opening doors, and flushing toilets. The curious Bengal will get into anything, and shifts in the home also allow the Bengal to react quickly. Open a cupboard, and if they are not up to his expectations, your Bengal will plunge in for a look-see and rearrange the contents.</p>
