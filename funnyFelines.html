          </div><h2>Now Presenting...</h2><p>You won't believe your eyes and ears after viewing the cat barking and once caught in the act, it becomes a cat again, immediately!</p></div>     
			  <h2 style="font-size: 25px;">Cat Gets Caught Barking</h2>
			  <p class="content_addOn">This video is funny to me because this feline gets caught barking like a dog, sounds like a dog, and I think it actually thought it was
			  a dog in that moment; however, once caught in the act, the cat decided it wanted to be a cat again. It amazes me how smart cats are and this
			  is evident. Imagine being that person on the opposite end of this video, seeing with their own two eye's, hearing this with their own ears...
			  I can imagine that a million thoughts must have ran through that person's mind and that they either wanted to enter that cat into some sort of talent show,
			  or wanted to see which other tricks that cat had looming to be exposed in the near future. When I initially located this video via social media years ago, I 
			  was in disbelief. I have seen cat's do some amazing things but this for me, took the cake. It literally looked as if it wanted to grab the attention of whoever it was 
			  outside during that time, to scare him or her away. As of now, I haven't seen any updates on how this cat is doing. Hopefully, just having fun, making the people around him or her laugh. See how fun it is to watch funny cat & kitten videos?

			  <h2 style="white-space: nowrap">Funny Cat & Kitten Compilation</h2>
			  <p class="content_addOn">Funny cat compilations are meant to brighten our days when we watch funny cat & kitten videos, and they do just that. There are many video’s we can visit online that consists of cat’s and kittens being their funny selves. 
			  This video in particular starts out with a bang of cuteness. Who wouldn’t love seeing these cute kitties in bed, playing in a pair of jeans? I personally find videos of this nature funny, yet cute. 
			  Seeing how inquisitive those kittens are as they are seeking to understand more in regard to their surrounding is always a pleasure. From playing with bubbles, to having a BALL, playing with a ball. Super Cute!!! 
			  There are so many moments during this short video that will make many smiles, which is why I had to add it. My favorite thing about watching funny kittens is when they walk sideways as they are planning an attack. Years ago, I owned a Manx kitten, which doesn’t have a tail. 
			  His name was Bugsy because he looked similar to Bugs Bunny, the cartoon character. I would literally laugh for a long time while playing with Bugsy. At times, he would jump out of nowhere in hopes of startling me. I’m not sure how he knew when to pounce, but it sure kept me in good spirits with laughter and consistent fun.
